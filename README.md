# Filter of love
## Our filter will help to avoid hate speech in games' chats and allow users to speak the language of love. 
*We know it's not your fault, it's just life is unfair sometimes*

**We're presenting a simple web chat created on Java where we have implemented the filter to reduce harassment and anger between users in a chat.**

To make the story short we suggest three filter steps before the user submit the message:
- Firstly, if the anger message detected (which is possible by parsing words from our _Bad Words_ dictionary) pop-up window appears with the warning (here you can also add some catchy quotes). The user has two options: either still publish the message or decide not to send insulting text.
- Secondly, if the user chooses to publish it we intend to suggest an alternative - let's say give some bonuses in order to encourage them avoid harassment speech. (Not implemented yet, but might be another good filter step)
- Finally, when the user anyway means to send the message to the chat we replace the _bad words_ by _nice_ ones, so the message looks cute.

We believe that three steps filtration will discourage users from trying to use hate speech at the first place. Knowing that the angry words will be replaced by something cute and funny anyway the users will have no motivation to try send something offending next time.
